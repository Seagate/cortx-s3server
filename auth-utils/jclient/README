How to build jclient
- cd auth-utils/jclient.
- mvn clean
- mvn package

Copy the jar file "jclient/target/jclient.jar" to your working directory.

Dependencies:
All the dependencies are installed via maven

Update /etc/hosts:
Add the following entries to /etc/hosts.
127.0.0.1    iam.seagate.com
127.0.0.1    sts.seagate.com
127.0.0.1    s3.seagate.com

Usage:
java -jar jclient.jar <Command>

Help
java -jar jclient.jar -h

NOTE
Option "-a" or "--aws" will run the command on AWS S3. This can be used by
developers to debug issues.
Jclient will search for default properties file "jclient.properties" in directory which
contains jclient.jar.
If default properties file is absent specify "-c" to configure properties file explicitly.

Example:

java -jar jclient.jar -c /root/s3server/st/clitests/jclient.properties
