Update /etc/hosts:
Add the following entries to /etc/hosts.
127.0.0.1    iam.seagate.com
127.0.0.1    sts.seagate.com
127.0.0.1    s3.seagate.com

Jcloudclient will search for default properties file "jcloud.properties" in directory which
contains jcloudclient.jar.
If default properties file is absent specify "-c" to configure properties file explicitly.
