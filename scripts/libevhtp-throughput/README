The toolset was designed for testing "bare" throughput of 'libevhtp' library.

To launch server simply run ./server executable.  Additional options:

 -port NNN -- to change the port (default 60080)
 -pool -- to enable s3server memory pool (off by default)

The server does not detach from console and logs messages to console.

Note: the binary when built is being linked against local library in source
code tree, but when it runs, it uses library installed in /opt/seagate.

It is possible to override library path:

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/your/path/to/libevent ./server ...options


The client neededs the packet 'libcurl-devel' for building and 'curl' packet
only for executing.

Client usage:

 ./client [-put] [-port NNN] <server_IP> <size>

Where 'size' is a decimal number with opt. suffix: 'k', 'm' or 'g'.
The client makes HTTP GET request if '-put' argument is ommited, and
does PUT when -put is specified.

The client forms URL like http://<server_IP>:<port>/<size>
The 'size' instructs the server how much data it should send while GET request.
The 'size' must be decimal number with optional suffix (K, M, G).

Examples of using third-party clients:

$ wget -O /dev/null -S --no-http-keep-alive http://<server_IP>:60080/<size>
$ dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/stdout bs=65536 count=32752 | \
curl http://<server_IP>:60080/<arbitrary_term> --upload-file -

Example of load test:

./server -port 5001 -pool

for i in `seq 20`; do \
      ( ./client -port 5001 -put 172.19.6.54 512m ; \
        ./client -port 5001 -put 172.19.6.54 512m) & \
      done
