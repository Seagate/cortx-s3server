Kafka server installation for cortx-s3server is two step process

1. Install and setup kafka.
2. Create topic for background delete.

see install-kafka.sh -h for usage.

Usage:

To install and configure kafka on 'N' node cluster run the script as follows:
sh install-kafka.sh -c N -i hosts
where "N" is number of consumers and hosts are cluster of hosts on whih kafka should be installed with comma seperated list

To create topic for background delete run the following script as follows:
sh create-topic.sh -c N -i hosts
where "N" is number of consumers and hosts are cluster of hosts on whih kafka should be installed with comma seperated list

e.g.
1. to install kafka on single node then run 
sh install-kafka.sh -c 1 -i ssc-vm-1271.colo.seagate.com
sh create-topic.sh -c 1 -i ssc-vm-1271.colo.seagate.com

2. to install kafka on three node cluster then run 
sh install-kafka.sh -c 3 -i ssc-vm-1271.colo.seagate.com,ssc-vm-1272.colo.seagate.com,ssc-vm-1273.colo.seagate.com
sh create-topic.sh -c 3 -i ssc-vm-1271.colo.seagate.com,ssc-vm-1272.colo.seagate.com,ssc-vm-1273.colo.seagate.com

bin/kafka-server-stop.sh config/server.properties
bin/zookeeper-server-stop.sh config/zookeeper.properties
