Link for installation and configuration steps of kafka (single node and cluster) are available at https://github.com/Seagate/cortx-utils/wiki/Kafka-Server-Setup

Kafka server installation for cortx-s3server is two step process

1. Install and setup kafka.
2. Create topic for background delete.

see install-kafka.sh -h for usage.

Usage:

To install and configure kafka on 'N' node cluster run the script as follows:
sh install-kafka.sh -c N -i hosts
where "N" is number of consumers and hosts are cluster of hosts on whih kafka should be installed with comma seperated list

To create topic for background delete run the following script as follows:
sh create-topic.sh -c N -i hosts
where "N" is number of consumers and hosts are cluster of hosts on whih kafka should be installed with comma seperated list

e.g.
1. to install kafka on single node then run 
sh install-kafka.sh -c 1 -i ssc-vm-1271.colo.seagate.com
sh create-topic.sh -c 1 -i ssc-vm-1271.colo.seagate.com

2. to install kafka on three node cluster then run 
sh install-kafka.sh -c 3 -i ssc-vm-1271.colo.seagate.com,ssc-vm-1272.colo.seagate.com,ssc-vm-1273.colo.seagate.com
sh create-topic.sh -c 3 -i ssc-vm-1271.colo.seagate.com,ssc-vm-1272.colo.seagate.com,ssc-vm-1273.colo.seagate.com


Troubleshooting:

1. To stop kafka services run the following commands
systemctl stop kafka
systemctl stop kafka-zookeeper

2. To kill all kafka processes run the following commands
ps -ef | grep kafka
kill -9 <process id>

3. To Kill processes listening on port 2181(zookeeper) 9092(Kafka)
 netstat -tulnp | grep 2181
 kill -9 <process id>
 
 netstat -tulnp | grep 9092
 kill -9 <process id>

4. Start kafka server manually
systemctl start kafka-zookeeper
systemctl start kafka

5. List topics
cd /opt/kafka
bin/kafka-topics.sh --list --bootstrap-server localhost:9092

If list topic command is successful then kafka is working fine.
