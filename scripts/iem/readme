Link for installation and configuration steps of kafka (single node and cluster) are available at https://github.com/Seagate/cortx-utils/wiki/Kafka-Server-Setup

Pre-requisites:
- Run the init.sh script which will install and configure kafka.

To configure IEM on 'N' node cluster run the script as follows:
sh configure-iem.sh -c N -i hosts
where "N" is number of consumers and hosts are cluster of hosts on whih IEM should be configured with comma seperated list

e.g.
1. To configure IEM on single node then run
sh configure-iem.sh -c 1 -i $HOSTNAME

2. To configure IEM on three node cluster then run
sh configure-iem.sh -c 3 -i ssc-vm-1271.colo.seagate.com,ssc-vm-1272.colo.seagate.com,ssc-vm-1273.colo.seagate.com

Troubleshooting:
To verify IEM configured successfully or not run the following command:
/opt/kafka/bin/kafka-topics.sh --list --bootstrap-server localhost:9092

If list topic command is successful and topic "IEM" is listed then IEM configured successfully.
e.g.

[root@ssc-vm-3161 iem]# /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-topics.sh --list --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
IEM
__consumer_offsets
bgdelete
