Configs and scripts to run a set of FIO tests on the hardware.

FIO tests allow to measure disk system bandwidth.

On the HW you're supposed to have multiple volumes mounted, so your test loads
will be directed to all or part of those volumes.  Be careful to not overwrite
any mounted volumes.  See runall.sh --help for details.

Usage:

# Create test output folder, where results will be stored:
mkdir /root/tmp/fio-2019-11-14
cd /root/tmp/fio-2019-11-14
/path/to/your/s3server.git/scripts/fio/runall.sh 20 mpathx mpathy mpathz ...

20 is the test run in seconds length with one load pattern (corresponds to fio
'runtime' option).  Can be any reasonable number.  In my tests, 20 seconds
was always enough to generate even load and get stable results.

./baseline.sh script can be run to review results and compare them with last
known good test results.
