******** Follow steps mentioned below on your laptop to configure your devvm ******

Centos 75 VM image is available at
    http://jenkins.mero.colo.seagate.com/share/bigstorage/sage_releases/vmdk_images/sage-CentOS-7.5.x86_64-7.5.1-k3.10.0-862.vmdk

1. Install ansible on your laptop
   - http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html
   Mac : http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#latest-releases-on-mac-osx
   Update Mac OS maintenance release if you are facing any issues for 'pip install ansible'

   Centos: yum install -y ansible

2. Create a VM using sage VM (centos 7.5 or earlier) and test ssh access

** Here onwards assumption is that you are in "<you s3server code>/ansible folder"

3. Download a folder named 'files' which is currently available in google drive location:
        https://drive.google.com/open?id=1QMPLcHjOT4q8xwDrCxZzsUPHPgMizu3R
   For Centos 75, additionally download lustre rpms from
         https://drive.google.com/open?id=1SZxCwoOUMRm78aQrazKTy8lz-XZIIHbE

4. Copy the downloaded folders from "files" to <your s3server code>/ansible/files/ directory
   Copy lustre rpms for Centos 7.5 to <your s3server code>/ansible/files/lustre/

5. Update <s3 src>/ansible/hosts file with IP address of your new VM.
   If you plan to run ansible within VM, use 127.0.0.1 for IP in <s3 src>/ansible/hosts file.
   Note: that [s3devvm] is just a ansible group name and NOT dev vm hostname.

6. Run ansible to setup the dev vm using appropriate .yml file. If you want to run
   with same VM, use option "--connection local" to below command.
   $ ansible-playbook -i hosts setup_s3dev_centos77_8.yml -v  -k

   It will prompt for ssh password and ldap password.
   For ldap password on dev vm, use "seagate" for rootDN and "ldapadmin" for IAM admin. These
   password values should be same as dev VM configs use above values.

   Your dev vm should be ready after successful run.

***************************** END Dev Vm setup ***************************************

******** Follow steps mentioned below on your laptop to configure your *openldap* node ******
*Note: Above dev VM setup does the openldap setup, so you dont need to repeat this.

1. For ansible install, see above steps.

2. Update <s3 src>/ansible/hosts file with IP address of your openldap node in section [s3ldapnode]

3. Run ansible to setup the openldap, enter the openldap password you want to setup.
   # ansible-playbook -i hosts openldap.yml -v  -k
   It will prompt for ssh password, followed by new openldap password.
   For ldap password on dev vm, use "seagate" for rootDN and "ldapadmin" for IAM admin
   Your openldap should be ready after successful run

******************************* END OpenLDAP setup **************************************


******** Follow steps mentioned below on your laptop to configure your *s3 release* node ******

1. For ansible install, see above steps.

2. Update <s3 src>/ansible/hosts file with IP address of your s3 node in section [s3releasenode]

3. Run ansible to setup the s3, enter the openldap password you want to setup.
   (Note: you may have to "yum install epel-release -y" if epel repo is not setup in node)
   # ansible-playbook -i hosts setup_release_node.yml -v  -k
   It will prompt for ssh password, followed by new openldap password.
   For ldap password for testing, use "seagate" for rootDN and "ldapadmin" for IAM admin
   Your s3 should be ready after successful run

******************************* END OpenLDAP setup **************************************


******** Follow steps mentioned below on your laptop to configure your *elasticsearch* node ******

1. For ansible install, see above steps.

2. Update <s3 src>/ansible/hosts file with IP address of your s3 node in section [elasticsearch]

3. Run the following ansible command to setup the elasticsearch
   # ansible-playbook -i hosts setup_elasticsearch.yml -v  -k
   It will prompt for ssh password.
   For ssh password, use "Xyratex"
   Your elasticsearch should be ready after successful run

******************************* END Elasticsearch setup **************************************
