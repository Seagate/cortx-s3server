# Logic is same for PUT Object & PUT chunk obj

- Fetch bucket metadata = bucket_metadata
- Fetch object metadata = object_metadata (old obj metadata if any)
- Create new object new-oid
- Add both old object OID "oldoid" and new object OID "newoid" to probable
  delete list with forceDelete=false.
  old obj entry has key = "oldoid-newoid" (see probable-delete-processing.txt)
  new obj entry has key = "newoid"
- Stream data to new obj newoid
- Save Version entry to version list index = new_object_metadata
- Save Object metadata to object list index = new_object_metadata
- Send response to s3 client
- if new object was saved Successfully:
  -- if old obj was present and overwrite
     --- mark forceDelete=True for oldoid
     --- Delete old object OID and version entry from version list
     --- if delete oldoid object successful then remove oldoid probable entry
         else oldoid probable entry stays in list so background delete can
         clean it up.
  -- Remove new oid probable record
- else if new object save failed
  -- if old obj was present and overwrite
     --- remove old obj probable record
  -- mark forceDelete=True for newoid
  -- delete new object
  -- if delete new obj successful then remove newoid probable record else newoid
     probable entry stays in list so background delete can clean it up.
