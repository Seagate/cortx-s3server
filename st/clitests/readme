s3cmd_spec.py :

What does it test:
- create bucket
- List buckets
- Create objects of size 3k, 8k and 700k.
- Download objects of size 3k, 8k and 700k.
- List objects
- List objects with specific starting pattern
- Delete objects.
- Delete Buckets.
- All above under 2 scenarios: pathstyle s3 uri and virtualhoststyle s3 uri

auth_spec.py :

What does it test:
- Create account
- Create, Delete, List and Update User
- Create, Delete, List and Update Access Key
- Create, Delete and List Roles
- Create, Delete, List and Update SAML Provider
- Get Federation Token.

Assumptions:
You have clean setup without a test bucket name 'seagatebucket', 'seagate-bucket'
and 'SEAGATEBUCKET123'.
Following access key pair is assumed, if your setup has different,
please update below mentioned s3cfg files.

System tests for auth server uses the python client 's3iamcli'.
Ensure you have all the dependencies installed for s3iamcli.

Python Version 3.6.3
Installing python36 and required packages to run S3 Auth cli and ST tests
   yum install wget epel-release
   yum install python36
   yum -y install python36-yaml
   yum -y install python36-scripttest

Below python modules can be downloaded from internal release management RPM Repository location 
or built from S3server Repo s3server/rpms/python36/buildrpm.sh script.
  - python36-xmltodict
  - python36-jmespath
  - python36-botocore
  - python36-s3transfer
  - python36-boto3

   yum localinstall python36-xmltodict-0.9.0-1.el7.centos.noarch.rpm
   yum localinstall python36-jmespath-0.9.0-1.el7.centos.noarch.rpm
   yum localinstall python36-botocore-1.6.0-1.el7.centos.noarch.rpm
   yum localinstall python36-s3transfer-0.1.10-1.el7.centos.noarch.rpm
   yum localinstall python36-boto3-1.4.6-1.el7.centos.noarch.rpm

System tests with ossperf uses tools like bc, parallel, md5sum and s3cmd
Ensure that you have all dependencies installed for ossperf
   yum install parallel
   yum install bc
   yum install coreutils
Install s3cmd rpm after building it from S3server Repo
s3server/rpms/s3cmd/buildrpm.sh script

Build Jcloud and Jclient and copy jcloud.jar and jclient.jar to the
current directory i.e st/clitests from the respective build directories.

Configuration:
cfg directory contains configuration files used by some system tests.
Edit corresponding configuration file to modify adjustable parameters
eg: To configure Motr-KVS as backend for System Test runs set S3_MOTR_IDX_SERVICE_ID: 1
```sh
cd cfg/
edit motrkvscli.yaml
```

How to run?
- Ensure you have s3server, auth server and motr running with test data.
- Update access keys in pathstyle.s3cfg and virtualhoststyle.s3cfg if required.
- Update /etc/hosts file to add following entry for tests.
  127.0.0.1 seagatebucket.s3.seagate.com s3.seagate.com
  127.0.0.1 seagate-bucket.s3.seagate.com seagatebucket123.s3.seagate.com seagate.bucket.s3.seagate.com
  127.0.0.1 s3-us-west-2.seagate.com seagatebucket.s3-us-west-2.seagate.com
  127.0.0.1 iam.seagate.com sts.seagate.com
- Ensure you have sourced motr_st (python version 3.5) with virtualenv.
- If you are not running as root add user to /etc/sudoers file
  - Run visudo to edit the /etc/sudoers file
  - Find section "User privilege specification". Add below line under it
  - <some_user> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
  - Note: Warning: This gives super user privilege to all commands when invoked as sudo.
- Add s3server binary path to sudo secure path
  - Run visudo to edit the /etc/sudoers file
  - Find line with variable "secure_path". Edit to add below path
  - /opt/seagate/cortx/s3/bin
- cd to clitests directory
- Note: For Dev environment, we use motr libs built from the source code. So before executing
  standalone systems tests or runallsystest.sh, export LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable pointing it
  to the source code motr libs location as below:
  # export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$(pwd)/../../third_party/motr/motr/.libs/:$(pwd)/../../third_party/motr/extra-libs/gf-complete/src/.libs/"

  After the tests are done, unset the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable as below:
  # unset LD_LIBRARY_PATH
- To verify setup and execute standard systests (auth, s3cmd, jclient and jcloud )
- run runallsystest.sh
- To execute system tests as standalone
- run $python auth_spec.py
- run $python s3cmd_spec.py
- run $python jclient_spec.py
- run $python jcloud_spec.py
- To unset the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable run `unset LD_LIBRARY_PATH`

Notes:
 - To get execution time in milli seconds (parsable format), make the
following change in the test script (ex - s3cmd_spec.py) before running the tests
set
   Config.time_readable_format = False

 - To run runallsystest.sh over HTTPS connection only
    $ ./runallsystest.sh
 - To run auth_spec.py over HTTP connection only, pass --no_https param to script
    $ ./runallsystest.sh  --no_https
